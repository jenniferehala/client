            <p>In many ways, JavaScript is the magic that brings the internet to life. Many of the most amazing new things we've seen on the web in the past 10 years are powered by JavaScript. Google Auto-complete, animations, dynamic transitions, single-page web applications, in-browser chat apps, loading screens, and drop down menus to name a select few. We almost take for granted how widespread JavaScript is. This is why we believe every developer should know at least some JavaScript!</p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <p>Not only that, no matter what stack or language you decide to code in, you will have some interaction with JavaScript. It's part of the big three client technologies. Not only that, it's the most widely used language of the web world. When you code in JS, you code in a language that more web developers can understand than any other language. This is why we recommend doing Algorithms in JavaScript as well. It makes a good technical interview language because it's so widely understood!</p>

            <h4>The Big Three:</h4>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Often times, when referring to the core languages of the internet, we talk about 'the big three'. These three technologies are present in just about every application you encounter on the web. Let's recap:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>HTML represents the content and the structure. We can think of this as the skeleton of a webpage. Elements are first placed into the Document Object Model, or the DOM, so that data can be represented on the browser.</li>
                <li>CSS represents the style and positioning of our HTML elements. We can think of this as the skin and clothes, the visual side of our website. Things like color, font, sizing, and positioning are all controlled in part by CSS..</li>
                <li>JavaScript is the action. We can think of it as the behavior of our website. You can build beautiful static websites with HTML & CSS, but they're not actually functional until we add logic. JS allows us to interact with our HTML & CSS by dynamically manipulating the DOM.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
