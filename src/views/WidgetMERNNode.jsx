            <p>Before you get started here is a quick note on how this curriculum has been laid out as well as a
                subjective gauge of how stressful each day is relative to the Belt Exam.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>As you can see we will be spending the first few days getting reacquainted with the JavaScript programming
                language, familiarizing ourselves with handy features of its current incarnation. We cover deployment as well and have plenty of time to prepare for the belt exam. The belt exam is
                undeniably a stressful day, but if you have used your time well you can and will be successful.</p>
